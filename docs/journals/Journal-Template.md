## Example Entry (for reference)

### Week 1
1/18/2016

**Tasks Completed:**
- Chose a project goal
- Reviewed SkinnySki.com
- Created this repository
- Wrote the problem statement
- Started documenting the project plan
- Began listing technologies and how they fit in this project

**Reflection:**  
I have a solid idea for the individual project and am anxious to get started. One area I struggled with a little bit was getting specific on the project plan with regard to what exactly I'll be doing in the later weeks. I think once I have the screen layout complete this coming week, it will make it much easier to add more detail to the plan.

**Next Steps:**
- Finalize screen layouts
- Add more detail to project plan
- Start testing integration with external services (weather, maps, etc.)
