## How to Use
- Each journal captures the narrative (tasks, wins, challenges, reflection) for that week.
- Plans & checklists record intent vs. outcome; journals capture the story and context.
- Update this index whenever a new week begins or retro is finalized.

## Template Guidance
If starting a new week:
1. Copy the previous week’s journal file.
2. Update header date and empty the daily sections.
3. Add link here and in main README quick links if desired.
